## Installing Déjà Dup On Raspbian

**Déjà Dup** is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of backing up the Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses duplicity as the backend.

To install **Déjà Dup** run the following command from a terminal window:

```console
sudo apt install deja-dup -y
```
Thats is all that is needed to install
